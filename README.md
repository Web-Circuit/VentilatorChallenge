# VentilatorChallenge
Design for a low-cost ventilator

## Introduction
As part of the effort to meet treatment requirements for patients suffering from COVID-19 (caused by novel coronavirus), there are multiple organizations looking for a low cost non-certified alternative to commercial ventilators. In order to meet the challenges around expected number of cases, which are projected to exceed capacity of hospitals, there is a premium on designs that can be built from commonly available components. This design is one attempt to meet that challenge.

## Short Description
This design is based on the concept of a 2-chamber bellows. Both chambers are compressed at the same time and expanded at the same time. Each of the chambers has an inlet tube and an outlet tube connected via a one-way valve. One inlet and one outlet are joined just below the mouthpiece, one providing fresh air as the bellows are compressed, the other evacuting the lungs when the bellows are expanded. The opposite outlet evacuates its attached chamber on compression, and the opposite inlet draws in fresh air from the room on expansion. Since one tube always provides fresh air and the other tube always evacuates stale air, the retained stale air is minimized.
